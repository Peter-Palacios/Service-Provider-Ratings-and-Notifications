Maintainability:
	Project divided into two separate services: Ratings and Notifications
	This separation can make it easier to manage or update the services without effecting the other

Reliability:
	Error Handling in the Ratings service includes handling and logging of errors during runtime
	HTTP response codes: services provide feedback on success or failure of requests
	
Scalability:
	Project Uses Docker to containerize the services, making it wasier to scale by deploying additional instances
	
	Notification service is statless, which improves scalability by handling mutliple requests at the same time without
	mainting internal state between requests. It also makes it easier to scale by adding more services
	
	Uses Decoupled Services: Ratings and Notifications servies communicate via HTTP, so they scale independently
