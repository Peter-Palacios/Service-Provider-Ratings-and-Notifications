Additional notes:

Before this assignment I never touched Docker or Go, so both technologies were completely new, but being a backend engineer is something I strive for so it was a great challenge and fun from my side.

Submitting project as-is for the sake of time.

Possible improvements :

Additional unit/integrations testing can be added manually or using additonal xUnit

Proper logging in Notification Service simliar to those in Rating Service

Timout handling for http requests

Caching for Rating service to reduce load on the data source
